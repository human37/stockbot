# stockbot

simple stock manager, checks the RSI and the MACD indicators using yahoo finance data, and emails the user when an event occurs. for example if the rsi of a stock gets below 30, it will send an email saying the stock is undervalued, and if the rsi is over 70 it will send a different email saying the stock is overvalued. similar behavior will occur with the MACD indicator also. once running, this will recalculate every 10 minutes.
