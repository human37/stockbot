# stockbot

Simple stock manager, checks the RSI and the MACD indicators using Yahoo Finance data, and emails the user when an event occurs. For example if the RSI of a stock gets below 30, it will send an email saying the stock is undervalued, and if the RSI is over 70 it will send a different email saying the stock is overvalued. Similar behavior will occur with the MACD indicator also. Once running, this will recalculate every 10 minutes.
